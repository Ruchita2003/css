              Exm- <head>
                  <style>
                    h1 {

                    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                </body> <br>
    <hr>

              Exm- <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
              </head>
              <body>
                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
              </body> <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Que-14 What is embedded style sheets?</h2><br>
    <p>

        It is defined within the <style> tags in the <head> section of the HTML file. <br>
        Exm- <html>
            <head>
                <head>
  <style>
    h1 {

    <p>
        Ans-Advantages of External Style Sheets: <br>

        Reusability: With external style sheets, you can define styles once and reuse them across multiple HTML files. <br> 
        Maintainability: Keeping CSS code separate in external files improves code organization and maintainability. <br>
        Efficiency: External style sheets can be cached by the browser, which means once a style sheet is loaded, subsequent page loads can use the locally stored version. <br>
        Browser Compatibility: External style sheets provide a consistent way to apply styles across different browsers. <br>

        Disadvantages of External Style Sheets: <br>

        Increased HTTP Requests: Using external style sheets requires an additional HTTP request to fetch the CSS file. <br>
        Dependency: External style sheets rely on the availability and correct linking of the CSS file.  <br>
        Complexity for Small Websites: For small websites with a limited number of pages and simple styling requirements, external style sheets might introduce unnecessary complexity. <br>
        Performance Impact: In certain cases, if an external style sheet is large and contains many unused styles, it can impact performance. <br>
